# Registration-form
This project involves the development of a user registration form featuring essential input fields such as Name, Email, Password, Date of Birth, Gender, and Address. The form includes client-side validation using JavaScript to ensure data integrity and proper format:

Email: Must follow a valid email format (example@domain.com).
Password: Must be at least 8 characters long, contain one uppercase letter, one number, and only specific special characters (+, -, /, *, %).
Real-Time Feedback: Displays user-friendly error messages for invalid input to guide the user in completing the form correctly.
The form is designed to be responsive and accessible, ensuring a smooth user experience across devices. This project is ideal for practicing front-end web development, form handling, and validation techniques.
